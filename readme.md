## Practical Test

- Reserve your timeslot for the practical test on the Booking page.

- The day before the test, you will get a video call link by email.
  Please check your setup and join 10 minutes early to avoid any
  technical issues, using the name you applied with, and turn on your
  camera. You won’t be able to join after the test starts.

- You will receive the test materials inside the video call. Unzip it
  and the word file contains the instructions.

- During the call, you will need to share your screen, and several
  examiners will be present. Using AI tools will lead to
  disqualification.

- After the test, email your completed work back by replying to the
  original email with test materials.

## Software requirements on your computer

Please install and familiarize with the software below.

- R
- RStudio
- SQLiteStudio
- Excel
- Word

## Reference Materials

The concept covered in this test can be found in the following
reference.

| Skills | Reference | Details |
|----|----|----|
| R | [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/) | We use everything mentioned in this book at work. |
| SQL | [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/default.asp) | SQL Tutorial section only (not SQL Database and References) |
| Excel | [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/excel/index.php) | All |

## R and RStudio (installation)

- Install R from here: <https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html>
- Install RStudio from here:
  <https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/>
- Install these packages: tidyverse, and any other analysis-related
  packages.

## SQLiteStudio (installation)

- Install SQLiteStudio: <https://sqlitestudio.pl/>
- Download a sample database for testing here:
  [download](assets/chinook.db)
- Open SQLiteStudio, and try if you can input the sample database:
  1.  Click Database (top left) \> Add a database

  2.  At “File”, click the folder icon and choose the `chinook.db` you
      have downloaded. \> Select \> OK

  3.  If you succeed in adding the database, you will see the database
      (item 1 shown below). Click the database name to see the table
      inside it.

  4.  Enter SQL statement in Query window (step 2), and click run button
      to see the output (Item 3).
- In the real test, we will provide another database to test your
  understanding in SQL statement.

## Practical test tips

- **Keep an eye on the time - it’ll fly by.** In the instruction
  document, we provided the distribution of marks for each section, so
  that you can keep track of time spent in each section. Email back to
  us within the time limit, with all your work including R and SQL
  scripts.

- **Do not worry that you may not get the right answer.** It’s more
  important to show your logical thinking through the working steps. For
  example, if 10 marks are assigned to a question, the steps themselves
  may get you 9 marks, and the right answer alone may just earn you 1
  mark.

- **Do not use AI tool like ChatGPT.**

## FAQ

- **Can a candidate use programming languages / tool not listed in the
  guidelines?** You must use R and SQL for the sections dedicated to
  those skills. However, you can use other programming languages in the
  other sections.

- **Can a candidate use the Internet during the test?** Yes, but you
  can’t copy directly, and you are not allowed to use any AI tools.

- **Can I reschedule the test?** Yes, please contact HR Team
  (<Jeremy.Gregory@gatewaycasinos.ca>) at least two business days before
  your scheduled test. We may not be able to accommodate last-minute
  changes, especially during non-office hours. Once the test is sent, we
  won’t reschedule it.
