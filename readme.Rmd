## Practical test

-   You will receive a practical test email from us at your selected time slot.

-   Unzip the attachment. Start with the document `00_Assessment Test.docx`. This file contains all the instructions.

-   Email back to us within 2 hours, with all your work including R and SQL scripts.

-   You can choose to take the test in our non-office hours (weekend or stat holiday), but we are out of the office at that time, so we could only respond to your email in the next business day. If you don't receive the test during the weekend, please contact HR Team (jgregory\@gatewaycasinos.com) and we may be able to re-arrange it accordingly.
